Context: It's rare for someone to stumble upon a brown recluse spider, because these eight-legged creatures are true to their name: They prefer to be left alone. They tend to live in indoor and outdoor spaces where people don't go most of the time.

They produce harmful venom that may cause a painful sore at the site of the bite. It may cause even more severe symptoms in some people. If you have a run-in with a brown recluse, it's wise to have a doctor check you out, just in case. A brown recluse might not be brown, but tan. It has a violin-shaped area on the front half of its body, with the neck of the violin pointing toward the spider's abdomen. It may be bigger than other spiders that you're used to seeing. Its body can range in size from a quarter-inch to three-quarters of an inch, and its long legs make it appear even larger. Most spiders have eight eyes, but a brown recluse spider has six. Two are in the front, and there are two more on each side of its head. Brown recluses are found mostly in the Midwest or the South. The spider favors indoor spaces, like attics, garages or dark closets. Outdoors, it hides in out-of-the-way places -- under logs, beneath porches, or within piles of rocks. A bite might not hurt at first or even leave a mark. For some people, it feels like a pinch or a bee sting. Within the first day or two after you've been bitten, you may notice: Pain or redness at the site of the bite A deep sore (ulcer) that forms where you were bitten, with the skin at the center turning purple Fever Chills Nausea Joint pain Feeling weak Seizures or coma (very rare) Your doctor will want to be as certain as he can that you were, in fact, bitten by a spider. It'll help if you can describe what the spider looked like. Some people try to catch the bug to show the doctor. That's fine, as long as you can do it safely. You might just try to take a photo of it. If you suspect your small child was bitten by a brown recluse, see your doctor right away. Their bodies can't ward off the dangerous effects of the spider's venom. For adults, most brown recluse spider bites can be treated at home with good results. But about 10% of them cause ulcers or blisters that damage your skin so badly that you need a doctor's care. If your symptoms are mild, try these simple home remedies: Clean it with soap and water. Apply antibiotic cream. If you were bitten on an arm or leg, keep it raised while you're resting. This can reduce swelling. Put ice on it. Take over-the-counter pain medicine. Watch for more severe symptoms. See a doctor right away if you notice any of these symptoms: The bite has formed an ulcer or blister with a dark (blue, purple or black) center. You're in extreme pain. You have an infection at the site of the bite. You're having trouble breathing. Some spider bites can have tetanus spores, so you might need a tetanus shot after you've been bitten. If you have an infection, you may need antibiotics.

Context: Ah, the joys of summer: The withering heat and school vacations, when your kids give you minute-to-minute updates on their boredom levels. Isn't summer supposed to be fun and relaxing? If you've got summer depression, it isn't. For some people, summer depression has a biological cause, says Ian A. Cook, MD, the director of the Depression Research Program at UCLA. For others, the particular stresses of summer can pile up and make them feel miserable. Especially hard is that you feel like you're supposed to be having a great time. Everyone else seems so happy splashing in the water and sweating in their lawn chairs. So why can't you? And more importantly, what can you do to make this summer easier? Here's what you need to know about summer depression. Why do some people feel more depressed in summer? Here's a rundown of reasons. Summertime SAD. You've probably heard about seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, which affects about 4% to 6% of the U. S. population. SAD typically causes depression as the days get shorter and colder. But about 10% of people with SAD get it in the reverse -- the onset of summer triggers their depression symptoms. Cook notes that some studies have shown that in countries near the equator â_x0080__x0093_ such as India â_x0080__x0093_ summer SAD is more common than winter SAD. Why do seasonal changes cause depression? Experts aren't sure, but the longer days, and increasing heat and humidity may play a role. Specific symptoms of summer depression often include loss of appetite, trouble sleeping, weight loss, and anxiety. Disrupted schedules in summer. If you've had depression before, you probably know that having a reliable routine is often key to staving off symptoms. But during the summer, routine goes out the window â_x0080__x0093_ and that disruption can be stressful, Cook says. If you have children in grade school, you're suddenly faced with the prospect of keeping them occupied all day, every day. If your kids are in college, you may suddenly find them â_x0080__x0093_ and all their boxes of stuff â_x0080__x0093_ back in the house after a nine-month absence. Vacations can disrupt your work, sleep, and eating habits â_x0080__x0093_ all of which can all contribute to summer depression. Body image issues. As the temperature climbs and the layers of clothing fall away, a lot of people feel terribly self-conscious about their bodies, says Cook. Feeling embarrassed in shorts or a bathing suit can make life awkward, not to mention hot. Since so many summertime gatherings revolve around beaches and pools, some people start avoiding social situations out of embarrassment. Financial worries. Summers can be expensive. There's the vacation, of course. And if you're a working parent, you may have to fork over a lot of money to summer camps or babysitters to keep your kids occupied while you're on the job. The expenses can add to a feeling of summer depression. â_x0080__x009c_ This summer, we have worries about the economic crisis layered on top of everything else,â_x0080__x009d_ says Cook. â_x0080__x009c_ People are feeling more financially strapped. They're wondering, â_x0080__x0098_ If I go on vacation, will the job still be there when I get back? 'â_x0080__x009d_ The heat. Lots of people relish the sweltering heat. They love baking on a beach all day. But for the people who don't, summer heat can become truly oppressive. You may start spending every weekend hiding out in your air-conditioned bedroom, watching Pay- Per- View until your eyes ache. You may begin to skip your usual before-dinner walks because of the humidity. You may rely on unhealthy takeout because it's just too stifling to cook. Any of these things can contribute to summer depression. What can help you feel better? What can you do to make this summer different? Here are some tips on taking control of summer depression. Get help. It's simple. If you think you're getting depressed, no matter what time of year, get help. Talk to a therapist, like a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker. Or see your general medical doctor or a psychiatrist who can evaluate whether medicines for depression might be appropriate. Never take the signs of depression lightly. Don't wait them out, assuming they'll resolve. Sometimes, what started as summer depression can turn into a longer-lasting bout of major depression, Cook tells Web MD. And even if your depression will resolve in September, that's no reason to ignore it in June. We're talking about three months of potentially avoidable misery. â_x0080__x009c_ A temporary depression can still be pretty awful,â_x0080__x009d_ says Cook. While the symptoms lift in a few months, the impact on your family and job can be permanent. Plan ahead. Cook says there's one advantage to a summer depression: you know when it's coming. June is right there on the calendar. So if you're feeling OK in the spring, think about the specific aspects of your life that become difficult during the summer. What will help prevent summer depression? What's the best way to take time off from work? Would signing up the kids for summer programs or camp help relieve your stress? You'll feel a lot more in control heading into the summer if you have plans in place. Sleep. Vacations, summer barbecues, the short nights â_x0080__x0093_ they can all encourage you to stay up later than usual. But not getting enough sleep is a common trigger for depression. So make a concerted effort to get to bed on time. Keep up with your exercise. Many studies have found that regular physical activity can help keep depression at bay. So even if it's getting too hot for your normal activities, find other ways to stay active and head off summer depression. Start earlier in the morning or later in the evening, when it's not so hot. Consider fitness equipment for the cool basement. If an annual membership to a gym is too expensive, consider joining one for a couple of months just to get you through the summer. Don't overdo dieting and fitness. Don't kick off the summer with a frenzy of dieting and exercise in order to fit into last year's bathing suit. It's bound to make you unhappy and anxious. Instead, exercise sensibly and eat moderately. If you try an insanely restrictive diet, you probably won't be able to keep it up. And that â_x0080__x009c_failureâ_x0080__x009d_ will just leave you more demoralized and worsen your summer depression. Protect yourself. Don't let obligations drag you down. Maybe you always host the enormous family barbecue on Memorial Day or the July 4 picnic. But if you're feeling overwhelmed, give it a pass this year. Ask another relative to host. Don't risk pushing yourself into a summer depression just to live up to tradition. Think about why. If you struggle with summer depression year after year, ask yourself if there's a reason. Do you associate summer with a difficult time in the past â_x0080__x0093_ the death of a loved one or the break-up of a relationship? Have you had previous bouts of depression during the summer? Without even realizing it, you may have started to associate the summer with sadness â_x0080__x0093_ an association that gets stronger every summer that you spend depressed. If you do have some unhappy connection with the summer, sorting it out could help you break the cycle. Talk to your doctor about adjusting your medication. If you're on medicine for depression, and you find that summer â_x0080__x0093_ year after year â_x0080__x0093_ makes your depression worse, talk to your doctor about changing your dosage. Maybe he or she could up your dose in the late spring and taper it back down in the fall. It could really help head off summer depression problems, Cook says. Plan your vacation carefully. Before you book your plane tickets or load up your car's roof rack for your annual summer vacation, ask yourself this: Is this what you really want? Or is it an obligation you're fulfilling to a relative? Will it make you happy? Or will it stretch your finances, stress you out, and make you fall behind at work? Consider alternatives. Instead of taking a whole week off at once, might it be better to take off several long weekends spread out through the summer? Would taking time off but staying at home â_x0080__x0093_ a â_x0080__x009c_staycationâ_x0080__x009d_ â_x0080__x0093_ be more relaxing? Don't get locked into a vacation that won't feel like a vacation. Don't beat yourself up. One thing that's hard about summer depression is that you feel so out of step. Everyone else seems to be having such a swell time. You aren't. You keep asking yourself, â_x0080__x009c_ What's wrong with me?â_x0080__x009d_ Try not to think that way. â_x0080__x009c_ So much of our misery grows out of the gap between where we are and where we think we ought to be,â_x0080__x009d_ says Cook. So stop worrying about how you feel relative to other people. Stop assuming that you're supposed to be happy just because the calendar says it's June. Instead, concentrate on what's triggering your summer depression and how you can overcome it. â_x0080__x009c_ Treatments do work,â_x0080__x009d_ says Cook. â_x0080__x009c_ Psychotherapy or medication can blunt the effects of a seasonal depression. Summers really don't have to be so bad.â_x0080__x009d_

Context: When you have RA, you're more likely to have certain other conditions. You and your doctor can work together to treat them. Use this list to know what symptoms to look for and why they happen. If you have this condition, you don't have enough red blood cells. Their job is to carry oxygen to all parts of your body. Many people with RA have it, and it can be treated. Symptoms: Fatigue Weakness Dizziness Headaches People with anemia sometimes also have pale skin, brittle nails, cold hands and feet, chest pain, or an irregular heartbeat. Or you may not have any symptoms at all. Treatment: When someone with RA has anemia, the first step is to lower inflammation and get the RA under control. You may also need to take iron supplements if you're low on iron. You can also get anemia from blood loss. Some RA medications can irritate your stomach and cause it. Your doctor will look for and treat the cause. People with RA are more likely than others to get heart disease or have a stroke. It is likely related to chronic inflammation. Symptoms: Heart disease doesn't always show symptoms before a crisis (like a heart attack or stroke) happens. You may have chest pain after you're active. Your doctor can check your cholesterol, blood pressure, and other things that can help predict illness. Treatment: If you have heart disease, your doctor will talk with you about your diet, exercise, weight, and stress. If you smoke, quit. Your doctor can give you advice to help with that. She may also prescribe drugs that lower cholesterol or blood pressure. This condition affects the glands that make tears and saliva. It's related to inflammation. Symptoms: For people with RA, the most common symptom of Sjogren's is dry eyes and mouth. It can also show up as dry skin, dry coughing, and vaginal dryness. Treatment: Artificial tears are the usual treatment for dry eyes. Some people may need special eye lubricants. Severe cases may require medications to tame the inflammation. If you have dry mouth, sip water often. Suck on sugarless candies so your body will make more saliva. If your case is severe, you may need medicine for it. This group of diseases can include scarring in the lungs, fluid in the chest, nodules in the lungs, or other problems. It's rare, but the drug methotrexate, which many people with RA take, can also cause lung problems. Symptoms: There aren't always warning signs, but when there are, they may include cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Ask your doctor if you should get a chest X-ray or other tests to check for problems. Treatment: The first step is to control inflammation. Your doctor may need to drain fluid around your lungs. If you have interstitial lung disease, which causes scarring, your doctor may prescribe steroids or other medications to reduce its progress. If scar tissue has built up in your lungs, it will stay, but medications may slow down the damage. Vasculitis is inflammation of the blood vessels. It's most common in advanced RA. The amount of damage depends on the size of the arteries. Inflammation of small and medium arteries, like those that lead to the fingertips and nails, can harm skin and tissues. When vasculitis hits larger arteries, it can lead to nerve damage, problems using your arms or legs, or damage to your internal organs. Symptoms: These vary, depending on what part of the body is affected. Treatment: Because vasculitis often means that RA is more severe, your doctor will focus on getting your disease under control. You may need even more intense treatment. Not everyone with RA gets depressed, but depression isn't unusual in people who have the disease. Symptoms may include: Deep feelings of sadness, anxiety, emptiness, hopelessness, worthlessness, and guilt Loss of interest in things you once enjoyed Insomnia Trouble concentrating or making decisions Treatment: Many people talk with a counselor and take antidepressants, if needed. If you have symptoms of depression, tell your doctor. That way, you can work together to figure out the best treatment for you and get started ASAP. In this condition, bones are fragile and thin, making them more likely to break. People with RA are more likely than other people to get osteoporosis. The disease may also cause bone loss, and so can some medications, like steroids. Also, if RA pain makes you less active, you might be more likely to get osteoporosis. Symptoms: Bone density tests can tell you if you have it. Otherwise, you might not know until its late stages. You could have back pain, stooped posture, a curved upper back, and fractures. You might also lose height. Treatment: Take these steps to treat and prevent osteoporosis: Eat a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, do weight-bearing exercises like walking or lifting weights, quit smoking, and limit alcohol. If needed, there are medications to treat and prevent the condition.

Context: It's the best situation: Stop a migraine before it starts. To do that, your doctor may consider these types of prescription drugs. Anticonvulsants. These are medicines that prevent or reduce seizures. Your doctor may recommend topiramate ( Qudexy XR, Topamax) or valproic acid ( Depakene, Depakote) to prevent your headaches. Beta-blockers. These relax your blood vessels. Your doctor may suggest metoprolol ( Lopressor, Toprol XL) or propranolol ( Inderal, Innopran XL). Botulinum toxin ( Botox). A doctor can inject small amounts around your face and scalp every 3 months to stop migraines from happening. Calcium-channel blockers. These include diltiazem ( Cardizem, Cartia, Covera HS, Tiazac) and verapamil ( Calan, Verelan). They ease the narrowing of your blood vessels. Antidepressants . Your doctor may prescribe amitriptyline ( Aventyl) or nortriptyline ( Pamelor). Research suggests duloxetine ( Cymbalta) and venlafaxine ( Effexor XR) may be helpful in preventing migraines. CGRP Inhibitors. CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is a molecule involved in causing migraine pain. CGRP inhibitors are a new class of drugs that block the effects of CGRP. Erenumab ( Aimovig) and fremanezumab ( Ajovy) are specifically approved to prevent migraine attacks. You give yourself an injection once a month with a pen-like device. You may want to consider medicine to prevent migraines if you: Have pain that hampers your life despite treatment Get at more than three moderate to severe headaches per month Take a lot of painkillers Don't get enough relief from meds you now take Have side effects from your headache drugs Have uncommon migraine conditions like continuing aura (blurred vision or seeing spots or wavy lines) Preventive medicine might not be right for you if: Your headaches are infrequent and controlled by anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and naproxen. Other health conditions keep you from taking preventive drugs. Those drugs could mix badly with other medicines you take. You prefer treatments that don't involve meds. If you can't take medication or prefer not to, there's also a device you and your doctor could consider. It's called Cefaly, and it's the first FDA-approved machine that prevents migraine in people over 18. It's a portable headband-like device that you wear around your forehead. It gives out electrical impulses that stimulate a nerve connected with migraines. You'll feel a tingling sensation and should use it once a day for 20 minutes. Your headaches may ease up during your second and third trimesters. If you have severe migraines, your doctor may suggest that you first try a treatment that's not a drug -- such as biofeedback, relaxation therapy, or stress management training. He may also recommend a preventive drug that has the lowest risk possible. Talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of taking preventive medications for migraine. Together, you can decide the best approach for you.

Context: If you feel a pain in your groin when you cough or lift something heavy, you may have what doctors call an inguinal hernia. It happens when a part of the small intestine or fat pushes through a weak area of your lower abdominal wall. This type of hernia is named for the inguinal canal. That's a passage in the lower abdominal wall that houses blood vessels and nerves, as well as the spermatic cord in boys and men, and ligaments that support the uterus in girls and women. An inguinal hernia could be a serious health problem, so you shouldn't ignore symptoms. A physical exam is usually all it takes to diagnose the problem. If the hernia is large enough, you'll need surgery to fix it. A baby can get an indirect inguinal hernia if the lining of their abdomen doesn't fully close while they're developing. What's left is an opening at the upper part of the inguinal canal. That's where a hernia can take shape. Older adults usually get a direct inguinal hernia because the muscles of their abdominal wall can weaken. Women rarely have this type of hernia. The broad ligament of the uterus is right behind the abdominal wall, which supports it and shields the inguinal canal. Men don't have that barrier, so stress and gradual weakening of their abdominal muscles over time make it more likely something can push through to the inguinal canal. It happens in 2% to 3% of male babies, but less than 1% of baby girls. About 1 in 4 males will have one at some time in their life. It's most common in men over the age of 40. Abdominal surgery can make you more likely to develop a direct inguinal hernia. A family history of this condition raises your odds, too. Smokers may have a higher chance of having inguinal hernias, as well as many other health problems. You can't prevent being born with a weaker abdominal wall. But you can take steps to avoid having problems because of it, such as not smoking and keeping your weight in check. If you have abdominal surgery, be careful afterward: Use your legs, not your back, when lifting. Avoid lifting heavy things. Try not to strain when you poop. You could have a direct inguinal hernia if you: Hurt when you cough, bend, or lift something heavy Feel pressure or weakness in your groin Have swelling around your testicles You may be able to gently push the bump back up into your abdomen to relieve some of the discomfort. See your doctor if you have symptoms of an inguinal hernia. Your doctor will check your groin area for swelling or a bulge. He'll probably ask you to stand and cough. This can make a hernia more obvious. If it hasn't produced any swelling that the doctor can see, he may order imaging tests, like an abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI. In some cases, if your hernia isn't treated, you could develop a serious complication called "strangulation." It happens when the small intestine gets stuck in the inguinal canal and can't be moved or massaged back into the abdomen. As a result of being "strangled," the intestines lose their blood supply. The affected part of the intestines can die. This is a major medical emergency. If you have an inguinal hernia and your belly hurts a lot, don't wait -- call 911. If you have an inguinal hernia, a high-fiber diet with plenty of veggies, fresh fruits, and whole grains may help you avoid constipation, which can lead to painful symptoms. Surgery can prevent strangulation, and it's the only way to fix an inguinal hernia. The doctor will push the bulging tissue back inside and strengthen your abdominal wall with stitches and perhaps mesh. She might be able to do this through a small cut in your belly using a special tool -- a procedure called laparoscopy -- which means you'll probably hurt less and heal faster than traditional surgery. An inguinal hernia can be quite painful, but it's definitely treatable. If you think you have one, see your doctor. It won't get better on its own.
